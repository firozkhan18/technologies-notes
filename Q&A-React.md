### 1. What is React?
**Definition:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where a dynamic and interactive user experience is required.

### 2. What are the major features of React?
- **Component-Based Architecture:** UI is divided into reusable components.
- **JSX:** A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.
- **Virtual DOM:** Efficient updates to the real DOM by using a virtual representation.
- **One-Way Data Binding:** Data flows in one direction, making it easier to understand how data changes affect the UI.
- **Hooks:** Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

### 3. What is JSX?
**Definition:** JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is then compiled to JavaScript functions.

**Example:**
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### 4. What is the difference between Element and Component?
- **Element:** A plain object describing what should appear in the UI. For example, `<div>Hello</div>` is an element.
- **Component:** A function or class that optionally accepts inputs (props) and returns a React element describing what should appear on the screen. Components can be reused and are more complex than elements.

### 5. How to create components in React?
- **Functional Component:**
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```
- **Class Component:**
```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

### 6. When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?
- **Class Component:** Use when you need to use lifecycle methods or manage state using `this.state` and `this.setState()`.
- **Function Component:** Preferable for simpler components, especially when using React Hooks for managing state and side effects.

### 7. What are Pure Components?
**Definition:** Pure components are components that implement `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow prop and state comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

**Example:**
```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    // Component logic here
  }
}
```

### 8. What is state in React?
**Definition:** State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. State can be modified using `setState()` in class components or `useState()` in functional components.

### 9. What are props in React?
**Definition:** Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component to configure or render it. Props cannot be changed by the child component.

### 10. What is the difference between state and props?
- **State:** Managed within a component and can change over time. Used for dynamic data.
- **Props:** Passed from parent to child components and are immutable within the child component. Used for static or external data.

### 11. Why should we not update the state directly?
**Reason:** Directly modifying state bypasses React’s state management and lifecycle methods, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and rendering issues. Always use `setState()` or `useState()` for updates.

### 12. What is the purpose of the callback function as an argument of `setState()`?
**Purpose:** To perform actions based on the state update. It runs after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.

**Example:**
```jsx
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }, () => {
  console.log('State updated:', this.state.count);
});
```

### 13. What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?
**Difference:** 
- **HTML:** Uses string-based event handling attributes (e.g., `onclick="handleClick()"`).
- **React:** Uses a camelCase syntax and functions (e.g., `onClick={this.handleClick}`).

### 14. How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?
**Options:**
- **Bind in constructor:**
```jsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
}
```
- **Arrow functions in render:**
```jsx
<button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Click</button>
```

### 15. How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?
**Example:**
```jsx
<button onClick={() => this.handleClick(param)}>Click</button>
```

### 16. What are synthetic events in React?
**Definition:** Synthetic events are React’s cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native events. They are normalized and consistent across different browsers.

### 17. What are inline conditional expressions?
**Definition:** Techniques for conditionally rendering elements in JSX using ternary operators or logical AND (`&&`).

**Example:**
```jsx
{isLoggedIn ? <LogoutButton /> : <LoginButton />}
```

### 18. What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?
**Definition:** The `key` prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. It improves performance by optimizing the re-rendering of lists.

### 19. What is the use of refs?
**Definition:** Refs are used to access and interact directly with DOM elements or React component instances.

### 20. How to create refs?
**Example:**
```jsx
const inputRef = useRef(null);
<input ref={inputRef} />
```

### 21. What are forward refs?
**Definition:** Forward refs allow components to forward refs to their children, enabling access to child DOM nodes or components.

**Example:**
```jsx
const FancyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <input ref={ref} {...props} />
));
```

### 22. Which is the preferred option with callback refs and `findDOMNode()`?
**Preferred:** Callback refs are preferred as `findDOMNode()` is considered legacy and less efficient.

### 23. Why are String Refs legacy?
**Reason:** String refs are considered legacy because they are less flexible and less reliable compared to callback refs and `React.createRef()`.

### 24. What is Virtual DOM?
**Definition:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React uses it to optimize rendering by updating only the parts of the real DOM that have changed.

### 25. How Virtual DOM works?
**Process:**
1. **Render:** React creates a virtual representation of the UI.
2. **Diffing:** React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one.
3. **Reconciliation:** React updates the real DOM based on the differences.

### 26. What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?
- **Shadow DOM:** Encapsulates styles and structure of a component, providing a separate DOM tree.
- **Virtual DOM:** A performance optimization for updating the real DOM efficiently by minimizing direct manipulations.

### 27. What is React Fiber?
**Definition:** React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React core algorithm that improves rendering performance and introduces features like incremental rendering and better support for async rendering.

### 28. What is the main goal of React Fiber?
**Goal:** To enable incremental rendering, allowing React to pause, abort, and continue rendering work, improving user experience and performance.

### 29. What are controlled components?
**Definition:** Controlled components are form elements whose value is controlled by React state. Changes are handled through event handlers.

**Example:**
```jsx
<input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
```

### 30. What are uncontrolled components?
**Definition:** Uncontrolled components store their own state internally and access values through refs rather than state.

**Example:**
```jsx
<input type="text" ref={this.inputRef} />
```

### 31. What is the difference between `createElement` and `cloneElement`?
- **`createElement`:** Creates a new React element.
- **`cloneElement`:** Clones and returns a new element with additional props.

### 32. What is Lifting State Up in React?
**Definition:** Moving state from a child component to its parent so that multiple child components can share and synchronize the state.

### 33. What are the different phases of component lifecycle?
- **Mounting:** Component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
- **Updating:** Component is being re-rendered due to state or prop changes.
- **Unmounting:** Component is being removed from the DOM.

### 34. What are the lifecycle methods of React?
**Class Component Lifecycle Methods:**
- **Mounting:** `constructor()`, `componentDidMount()`
- **Updating:** `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `componentDidUpdate()`
- **Unmounting:** `componentWillUnmount()`

### 35. What are Higher-Order components?
**Definition:** Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced functionality.

**Example:**
```jsx
function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Component mounted');
    }
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}
```

### 36. How to create props proxy for HOC component?
**Example:**
```jsx
const withPropsProxy = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      const

 newProps = { ...this.props, newProp: 'value' };
      return <WrappedComponent {...newProps} />;
    }
  };
};
```

### 37. What is context?
**Definition:** Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### 38. What is children prop?
**Definition:** The `children` prop is a special prop that allows components to pass nested elements to their children.

**Example:**
```jsx
function Container({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

### 39. How to write comments in React?
**Syntax:**
```jsx
{/* This is a comment */}
```

### 40. What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?
**Purpose:** To initialize the parent class (React.Component) with the props, allowing access to `this.props` in the constructor of a class component.

**Example:**
```jsx
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { /* state initialization */ };
}
```

### 41. What is reconciliation?
**Definition:** Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM with changes based on the virtual DOM’s diffing algorithm.

### 42. How to set state with a dynamic key name?
**Example:**
```jsx
this.setState(prevState => ({
  [dynamicKey]: newValue
}));
```

### 43. What would be the common mistake of a function being called every time the component renders?
**Mistake:** Defining a function inside the render method. This creates a new function on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders of child components.

### 44. Does `lazy` function support named exports?
**No:** `React.lazy` supports default exports only. Named exports should be wrapped in a default export.

### 45. Why does React use `className` over `class` attribute?
**Reason:** `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, so React uses `className` to avoid conflicts.

### 46. What are fragments?
**Definition:** Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

**Example:**
```jsx
<>
  <Child1 />
  <Child2 />
</>
```

### 47. Why are fragments better than container divs?
**Reason:** Fragments do not add extra nodes to the DOM, which helps keep the DOM structure cleaner and avoids unnecessary elements.

### 48. What are portals in React?
**Definition:** Portals allow rendering children into a different part of the DOM outside of the parent component’s DOM hierarchy.

**Example:**
```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)
```

### 49. What are stateless components?
**Definition:** Stateless components are components that do not manage state and only rely on props for rendering.

**Example:**
```jsx
function StatelessComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.text}</div>;
}
```

### 50. What are stateful components?
**Definition:** Stateful components manage their own state and use it to control rendering and behavior.

**Example:**
```jsx
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return <div>{this.state.count}</div>;
  }
}
```

### 51. How to apply validation on props in React?
**Method:** Use `PropTypes` to define expected types and required props.

**Example:**
```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: PropTypes.number
};
```

### 52. What are the advantages of React?
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Modular and reusable components.
- **Virtual DOM:** Efficient rendering and updates.
- **Declarative Syntax:** Easier to understand and debug.
- **Strong Community and Ecosystem:** Wide range of libraries and tools.

### 53. What are the limitations of React?
- **Learning Curve:** Requires understanding JSX, components, and state management.
- **Boilerplate:** Often involves additional setup and tooling.
- **SEO Challenges:** Client-side rendering can be challenging for SEO unless server-side rendering is used.

### 54. What are error boundaries in React v16?
**Definition:** Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and log those errors or display fallback UI.

**Example:**
```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### 55. How were error boundaries handled in React v15?
**Answer:** React v15 did not have error boundaries. Error handling in v15 was typically done with try-catch blocks and error handling in lifecycle methods.

### 56. What are the recommended ways for static type checking?
- **PropTypes:** For runtime type checking of props.
- **TypeScript:** For static type checking and integrating types into your development workflow.

### 57. What is the use of `react-dom` package?
**Definition:** The `react-dom` package provides DOM-specific methods to mount and unmount React components and manage updates to the DOM.

### 58. What is the purpose of the `render` method of `react-dom`?
**Purpose:** To render a React component tree into the DOM.

**Example:**
```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### 59. What is `ReactDOMServer`?
**Definition:** `ReactDOMServer` is used for server-side rendering of React components, allowing you to generate HTML on the server.

### 60. How to use `innerHTML` in React?
**Example:**
```jsx
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: '<p>HTML content</p>' }} />
```
**Caution:** Use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` sparingly to avoid XSS attacks.

### 61. How to use styles in React?
**Options:**
- **Inline Styles:**
```jsx
const style = { color: 'blue' };
<div style={style}>Hello</div>
```
- **CSS Modules:** 
```jsx
import styles from './styles.module.css';
<div className={styles.myClass}>Hello</div>
```
- **Styled Components:** Use libraries like `styled-components` for CSS-in-JS.

### 62. How are events different in React?
**Difference:** React wraps native events in synthetic events, which are normalized and consistent across browsers.

### 63. What will happen if you use `setState` in the constructor?
**Outcome:** Using `setState` in the constructor will not have any effect because the component is not yet mounted. Initialization of state should be done directly in the constructor.

### 64. What is the impact of indexes as keys?
**Impact:** Using array indexes as keys can lead to performance issues and component state problems, especially when items are reordered or removed. It’s better to use unique IDs.

### 65. Is it good to use `setState()` in `componentWillMount()` method?
**Answer:** No, `componentWillMount()` is deprecated. Use `componentDidMount()` for making changes to state or side effects.

### 66. What will happen if you use props in initial state?
**Answer:** It can lead to problems if the props change after initial render. Use `getDerivedStateFromProps` or `componentDidUpdate` for synchronizing state with props.

### 67. How do you conditionally render components?
**Methods:**
- **Ternary Operator:** 
```jsx
{isLoggedIn ? <LogoutButton /> : <LoginButton />}
```
- **Logical AND (`&&`):**
```jsx
{showContent && <Content />}
```

### 68. Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?
**Reason:** Spreading props on DOM elements can inadvertently pass unwanted attributes or props to the DOM, leading to potential bugs or warnings.

### 69. How do you use decorators in React?
**Answer:** Decorators are a proposed feature and are not part of the core React library. They can be used with tools like Babel to modify class behavior.

### 70. How do you memoize a component?
**Methods:**
- **`React.memo`:** For functional components.
```jsx
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(Component);
```
- **`useMemo` and `useCallback`:** For optimizing specific functions or values.

### 71. How do you implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
**Method:** Use `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` or frameworks like Next.js for server-side rendering to generate HTML on the server.

### 72. How to enable production mode in React?
**Method:** Set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `"production"` during build and deployment.

### 73. What is CRA and its benefits?
**Definition:** CRA (Create React App) is a tool for setting up a new React project with a modern build setup. Benefits include zero configuration, built-in development tools, and optimized builds.

### 74. What is the lifecycle methods order in mounting?
**Order:**
1. `constructor()`
2. `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`
3. `render()`
4. `componentDidMount()`

### 75. What lifecycle methods are

 going to be deprecated in React v16?
**Deprecated Methods:**
- `componentWillMount()`
- `componentWillReceiveProps()`
- `componentWillUpdate()`

### 76. What is the purpose of `getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle method?
**Purpose:** To derive state from props before rendering. It’s called right before rendering, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates.

### 77. What is the purpose of `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` lifecycle method?
**Purpose:** To capture some information from the DOM before it is potentially changed. Useful for reading layout information.

### 78. Do Hooks replace render props and higher-order components?
**Answer:** Hooks provide a simpler and more direct way to reuse stateful logic and side effects, which can often replace the need for render props and higher-order components.

### 79. What is the recommended way for naming components?
**Recommendation:** Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `MyComponent`) to distinguish them from HTML elements and JavaScript functions.

### 80. What is the recommended ordering of methods in a component class?
**Recommended Order:**
1. Constructor
2. Static methods (e.g., `getDerivedStateFromProps`)
3. Lifecycle methods
4. Event handlers
5. Render method

### 81. What is a switching component?
**Definition:** A switching component (often used with React Router) renders different components based on the current URL or route.

### 82. Why do we need to pass a function to `setState()`?
**Reason:** To ensure that state updates are based on the previous state, especially when updates are asynchronous or depend on the current state.

### 83. What is Strict Mode in React?
**Definition:** Strict Mode is a development-only feature that helps identify potential problems in an application by activating additional checks and warnings.

### 84. What are React Mixins?
**Definition:** Mixins were a way to reuse code across multiple components but are now deprecated in favor of higher-order components and hooks.

### 85. Why is `isMounted()` an anti-pattern and what is the proper solution?
**Reason:** `isMounted()` is considered unreliable. Use `componentDidMount()` and `componentWillUnmount()` to handle setup and cleanup.

**Supported Events:**
- `onPointerDown`
- `onPointerUp`
- `onPointerMove`
- `onPointerEnter`
- `onPointerLeave`
- `onPointerCancel`

### 87. Why should component names start with a capital letter?
**Reason:** Component names must start with a capital letter to distinguish them from HTML tags and to enable JSX to properly recognize them.

### 88. Are custom DOM attributes supported in React v16?
**Yes:** React v16 supports custom attributes as long as they do not clash with standard HTML attributes or React-specific attributes.

### 89. What is the difference between constructor and `getInitialState`?
- **Constructor:** Initializes state and binds methods in ES6 classes.
- **`getInitialState`:** Was used in React's earlier versions (before ES6 classes) to initialize state.

### 90. Can you force a component to re-render without calling `setState`?
**Method:** Yes, you can force a re-render by calling `forceUpdate()`, but this is generally discouraged. `setState` should be used for state changes.

### 91. What is the difference between `super()` and `super(props)` in React using ES6 classes?
- **`super()`:** Calls the parent class constructor without passing props.
- **`super(props)`:** Calls the parent class constructor and passes props, allowing access to `this.props` in the constructor.

### 92. How to loop inside JSX?
**Method:** Use JavaScript array methods like `map()` to iterate and render elements.

**Example:**
```jsx
const items = ['Item1', 'Item2', 'Item3'];
const listItems = items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

### 93. How do you access props in attribute quotes?
**Example:**
```jsx
const Greeting = ({ name }) => <div>Hello, {name}</div>;
```

### 94. What is React PropType array with shape?
**Definition:** A way to validate the shape of array elements using PropTypes.

    name: PropTypes.string
  }))
};
```

### 95. How to conditionally apply class attributes?
**Example:**
```jsx
const className = isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive';
<div className={className}>Content</div>
```

### 96. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?
- **React:** Core library for building components and managing the virtual DOM.
- **ReactDOM:** Provides methods to render React components to the actual DOM.

### 97. Why is ReactDOM separated from React?
**Reason:** Separation allows React to focus on building components and managing state while ReactDOM handles the specific tasks related to DOM manipulation.

### 98. How to use React label element?
**Example:**
```jsx
<label htmlFor="inputId">Label</label>
<input id="inputId" />
```

### 99. How to combine multiple inline style objects?
**Example:**
```jsx
const style1 = { color: 'red' };
const style2 = { fontSize: '20px' };
const combinedStyle = { ...style1, ...style2 };

<div style={combinedStyle}>Styled Text</div>
```

### 100. How to re-render the view when the browser is resized?
**Method:** Use the `resize` event listener to handle window size changes.

**Example:**
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    // handle resize
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  };
}, []);
```

### 101. What is the difference between `setState` and `replaceState` methods?
- **`setState`:** Merges the provided state into the current state.
  ```jsx
  this.setState({ name: 'John' });
  ```
- **`replaceState`:** Replaces the entire state with the provided state. Note that `replaceState` is deprecated in React and should not be used.
  ```jsx
  this.replaceState({ name: 'John' });
  ```

### 102. How to listen to state changes?
- **Method:** Use `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method in class components or `useEffect` hook in function components to respond to state changes.
  ```jsx
  // Class Component
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    if (this.state.someValue !== prevState.someValue) {
      // handle state change
    }
  }

  // Function Component
  useEffect(() => {
    // handle state change
  }, [stateValue]);
  ```

### 103. What is the recommended approach of removing an array element in React state?
- **Method:** Use array methods like `filter()` to create a new array excluding the item you want to remove, and then update state with this new array.
  ```jsx
  this.setState(prevState => ({
    items: prevState.items.filter(item => item.id !== idToRemove)
  }));
  ```

### 104. Is it possible to use React without rendering HTML?
- **Answer:** Yes, React can be used for server-side rendering, generating components that don't directly render HTML but instead output JSON or other formats.

### 105. How to pretty print JSON with React?
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';

  function PrettyPrintJson({ data }) {
    return (
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    );
  }
  ```

### 106. Why you can't update props in React?
- **Reason:** Props are immutable and meant to be read-only. Components should use props to render data and can only change their internal state using `setState`.

### 107. How to focus an input element on page load?
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

  function MyComponent() {
    const inputRef = useRef(null);

      inputRef.current.focus();
    }, []);

    return <input ref={inputRef} />;
  }
  ```

### 108. What are the possible ways of updating objects in state?
- **Methods:**
  - **Using `setState` in Class Components:**

  function App() {
    const location = useLocation();

    ReactGA.initialize('UA-000000-01');
    ReactGA.pageview(location.pathname + location.search);

    return (
      // your routes here
    );
  }
  ```

### 115. How to update a component every second?
- **Method:** Use `setInterval` within `useEffect` in function components or `componentDidMount` in class components.
  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      // update state or perform actions
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);
  ```

### 116. How do you apply vendor prefixes to inline styles in React?
- **Method:** Use the `style` attribute with camelCase properties. For complex cases, use libraries like `autoprefixer` or `inline-style-prefixer`.
  ```jsx
  const style = { display: 'flex', WebkitBoxShadow: '0px 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)' };
  ```

### 117. How to import and export components using React and ES6?
- **Import:**
  ```jsx
  import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
  ```
- **Export:**
  ```jsx

    const query = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
    const param = query.get('param');
    return <div>Param: {param}</div>;
  }
  ```

### 135. Why you get "Router may have only one child element" warning?
- **Reason:** React Router requires a single child element to manage routing. You can wrap multiple elements in a `<div>` or `<Fragment>`.

- **Definition:** A state management library for JavaScript applications that follows the Flux architecture, with a single source of truth and pure reducers.

### 154. What are the core principles of Redux?
- **Principles:**
  - **Single Source of Truth:** The state of the entire application is stored in a single object.
  - **State is Read-Only:** The only way to change the state is by dispatching actions.
  - **Changes are Made with Pure Functions:** To specify how the state changes, you write pure reducers.

### 155. What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?
- **Downsides:**
  - **Boilerplate:** Redux requires more boilerplate code compared to Flux.
  - **Learning Curve:** The concepts can be more complex for beginners.

### 156. What is the difference between `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`?
- **`mapStateToProps`:** Maps state from the Redux store to component props.
  ```jsx
  const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    items: state.items
  });
  ```
- **`mapDispatchToProps`:** Maps dispatch functions to component props.
  ```jsx
  const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
    addItem: item => dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', item })
  });
  ```

### 157. Can I dispatch an action in a reducer?
- **No:** Actions should be dispatched in components or middleware, not within reducers. Reducers should be pure functions and only handle state transformations.

### 158. How to access Redux store outside a component?
- **Method:** Use the `store` instance directly if needed, or connect the component to the store via `connect` from `react-redux`.

### 159. What are the drawbacks of the MVW pattern?
- **Drawbacks:** MVW can become complex and less maintainable compared to more modern patterns like MVVM or using state management libraries like Redux.

### 160. Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS?
- **Similarities:** Both manage state and handle asynchronous operations, though Redux focuses on state management with actions and reducers, while RxJS uses observables and operators.

### 161. How to dispatch an action on load?
- **Method:** Dispatch actions in `componentDidMount` for class components or `useEffect` for function components.
  ```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchData());
  }, [dispatch]);
  ```

### 162. How to use `connect` from React Redux?
- **Method:** Use `connect` to bind Redux state and dispatch to component props.
  ```jsx
  import { connect } from 'react-redux';

  function MyComponent({ items, addItem }) {
    // component implementation
  }

  const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    items: state.items
  });

  const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
    addItem: item => dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', item })
  });

  export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);
  ```

### 163. How to reset state in Redux?
- **Method:** Dispatch an action that sets the state to its initial value, handled by the reducer.
  ```jsx
  const initialState = { ... };

  function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'RESET_STATE':
        return initialState;
      // other cases
    }
  }
  ```

### 164. What’s the purpose of the `@` symbol in the Redux `connect` decorator?
- **Purpose:** The `@` symbol is not used in Redux or `connect`. It might be a misunderstanding or confusion with decorators in other contexts.

### 165. What is the difference between React context and React Redux?
- **React Context:** Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props.
- **Redux:** A state management library that provides a more structured and predictable way to manage global state with actions and reducers

.

### 166. Why are Redux state functions called reducers?
- **Reason:** Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state. The term "reducer" comes from functional programming, where such functions are used to reduce a list of values into a single value.

### 167. How to make AJAX requests in Redux?
- **Method:** Use middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga` to handle asynchronous operations and dispatch actions based on the request results.

### 168. Should I keep all component's state in Redux store?
- **Recommendation:** Only keep global or shared state in Redux. Local state that is only used within a single component should be managed using React's `useState` or `useReducer`.

### 169. What is the proper way to access the Redux store?
- **Method:** Use the `useSelector` hook to access the store state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions in function components, or `connect` in class components.

### 170. What is the difference between a component and a container in React Redux?
- **Component:** Typically a presentational component that only receives props and displays data.
- **Container:** A component that connects to the Redux store and dispatches actions. It often contains logic and state.

### 171. What is the purpose of constants in Redux?
- **Purpose:** To avoid typos and ensure consistency when referring to action types. Constants represent action types in a single location.

### 172. What are the different ways to write `mapDispatchToProps()`?
- **Ways:**
  - **Object Syntax:**
    ```jsx
    const mapDispatchToProps = {
      addItem: item => ({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', item })
    };
    ```
  - **Function Syntax:**
    ```jsx
    const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
      addItem: item => dispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', item })
    });
    ```

### 173. What is the use of the `ownProps` parameter in `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()`?
- **Purpose:** Provides access to the props that were passed to the component, allowing you to derive new props based on them.

### 174. How to structure Redux top-level directories?

- **Definition:** A middleware library for managing side effects in Redux applications using generator functions.

### 176. What is the mental model of redux-saga?
- **Model:** Think of sagas as long-running processes that listen for dispatched actions and perform asynchronous operations before dispatching new actions.

### 177. What are the differences between `call` and `put` in redux-saga?
- **`call`:** Used to invoke functions or promises.
- **`put`:** Dispatches actions to the Redux store.

### 178. What is Redux Thunk?
- **Definition:** A middleware for handling asynchronous actions in Redux, allowing action creators to return functions instead of actions.

### 179. What are the differences between redux-saga and redux-thunk?
- **`redux-saga`:** Uses generator functions for handling complex side effects and control flow.
- **`redux-thunk`:** Uses simple functions and provides a straightforward way to handle asynchronous actions.

  ```jsx
  import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
  import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
  import saga from 'redux-saga';

  const store = createStore(
    rootReducer,
    applyMiddleware(thunk, saga)
  );
  ```

### 186. How to set initial state in Redux?
- **Method:** Define the initial state in the reducer function and use it as the default value.
  ```jsx
  const initialState = { ... };

  function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
    // reducer logic
  }
  ```

### 187. How is Relay different from Redux?
- **Difference:** Relay is a framework for managing GraphQL data and handling data-fetching logic, whereas Redux is a general state management library for JavaScript applications.

### 188. What is an action in Redux?
- **Definition:** An object representing a change or event that should be processed by the reducer. It typically has a `type` and an optional payload.

  const getFilter = state => state.filter;

  const getVisibleItems = createSelector(
    [getItems, getFilter],
    (items, filter) => items.filter(item => item.includes(filter))
  );

  // Usage
  const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    items: getVisibleItems(state)
  });
  ```

### React ES6 Classes and Redux

### 209. Does the statics object work with ES6 classes in React?
- **Yes:** Static properties and methods can be defined in ES6 classes, and React allows defining static methods on class components, such as `getDerivedStateFromProps`.

### 210. Can Redux only be used with React?
- **No:** Redux is a standalone state management library that can be used with any JavaScript framework or library. It’s commonly used with React due to its integration with React’s component model.

### 211. Do you need to have a particular build tool to use Redux?
- **No:** Redux can be used with any build tool. It’s framework-agnostic and doesn’t require a specific build tool.

### 212. How Redux Form `initialValues` get updated from state?
- **Method:** Redux Form updates `initialValues` when the `initialValues` prop changes. It uses `shouldComponentUpdate` to check for changes and update the form state accordingly.

### React PropTypes

### 213. How React PropTypes allow different types for one prop?
- **Method:** Use `PropTypes.oneOfType` to specify multiple types for a prop.
  ```jsx
  MyComponent.propTypes = {
    value: PropTypes.oneOfType([
      PropTypes.string,
      PropTypes.number
    ])
  };
  ```

### SVGs and Ref Callbacks

### 214. Can I import an SVG file as a React component?
- **Yes:** Using a tool like `@svgr/webpack`, you can import SVG files as React components.
  ```jsx
  import { ReactComponent as MyIcon } from './my-icon.svg';

  function App() {
    return <MyIcon />;
  }
  ```

### 215. Why are inline ref callbacks or functions not recommended?
- **Reason:** Inline ref callbacks can lead to performance issues because they create a new function on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders or performance degradation.

### Render Hijacking and HOC Factory Implementations

### 216. What is render hijacking in React?
- **Definition:** Render hijacking refers to overriding or altering the default rendering behavior of a component. It is often done in higher-order components (HOCs) to inject additional logic or wrap components with additional functionality.

### 217. What are HOC factory implementations?
- **Definition:** Higher-order component (HOC) factory implementations are functions that create HOCs. They take component(s) as arguments and return a new component with additional functionality.

### Passing Numbers and State Management

### 218. How to pass numbers to React component?
- **Method:** Pass numbers as props just like any other data type.
  ```jsx
  function MyComponent({ count }) {
    return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
  }

  function App() {
    return <MyComponent count={5} />;
  }
  ```

### 219. Do I need to keep all my state into Redux? Should I ever use React internal state?
- **Recommendation:** Only keep global or shared state in Redux. Use React's internal state (`useState`, `useReducer`) for local component state.

### Service Workers and React Memo

### 220. What is the purpose of `registerServiceWorker` in React?
- **Purpose:** Registers a service worker to enable offline capabilities and caching for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Service workers help cache assets and serve them from the cache, improving performance and offline functionality.

- **Definition:** `React.lazy` is a function that allows you to dynamically import components and perform code-splitting, loading components only when they are needed.

### 223. How to prevent unnecessary updates using `setState`?
- **Method:** Use functional `setState` updates to ensure you’re working with the latest state, and avoid unnecessary re-renders by using `React.memo` or `PureComponent`.

### JSX Rendering and Component Classes

### 224. How do you render Array, Strings, and Numbers in React 16 Version?
- **Method:** React 16 supports rendering arrays, strings, and numbers directly in JSX.
  ```jsx
  function MyComponent() {
    const items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
    return (
      <div>
        {items.map(item => <div key={item}>{item}</div>)}
        <div>{100}</div>
        <div>{'Hello, world!'}</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

### 225. How to use class field declarations syntax in React classes?
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    state = {
      count: 0
    };

    handleClick = () => {
      this.setState(prevState => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
    };

    render() {
      return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.state.count}</button>;
    }
  }
  ```

### Hooks and Their Rules

### 226. What are hooks?
- **Definition:** Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

### 227. What are the rules that need to be followed for hooks?
- **Rules:**
  - **Call hooks at the top level:** Don’t call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
  - **Call hooks from React functions:** Only call hooks from React functional components or custom hooks.

### 228. How to ensure hooks follow the rules in your project?
- **Method:** Use ESLint rules with the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin, which enforces the rules of hooks and helps avoid common mistakes.

### Flux vs Redux

### 229. What are the differences between Flux and Redux?
- **Differences:**
  - **Flux:** An architecture pattern with multiple stores and unidirectional data flow.
  - **Redux:** A state management library with a single store and a more strict set of rules and patterns for managing state.

### Error Boundaries and Lifecycle Methods

### 230. What are the benefits of React Router V4?
- **Benefits:**
  - **Declarative Routing:** Uses JSX to define routes, making it more readable.
  - **Dynamic Routing:** Supports route nesting and dynamic routes.
  - **Code Splitting:** Supports lazy loading and code splitting.

### 231. Can you describe the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method signature?
- **Signature:

**
  ```jsx
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // error: the error that was thrown
    // info: an object with component stack trace
  }
  ```

### 232. In which scenarios do error boundaries not catch errors?
- **Scenarios:**
  - **Event Handlers:** Errors in event handlers don’t get caught by error boundaries.
  - **Asynchronous Code:** Errors in async code (e.g., setTimeout, Promises) are not caught by error boundaries.
  - **Server-Side Rendering:** Errors during server-side rendering may not be caught by error boundaries.

### 233. Why do you not need error boundaries for event handlers?
- **Reason:** Errors in event handlers are not caught by React’s error boundaries. Instead, you should handle errors directly within the event handler.

### 234. What is the difference between try-catch block and error boundaries?
- **Difference:**
  - **try-catch:** Used for handling synchronous errors within a specific code block.
  - **Error Boundaries:** Used for catching errors that occur in the component tree and rendering fallback UI.

### 235. What is the behavior of uncaught errors in React 16?
- **Behavior:** Uncaught errors in React 16 trigger the error boundary, which provides a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app.

### 236. What is the proper placement for error boundaries?
- **Placement:** Wrap error boundaries around components or sections of your app where you want to handle potential errors and display fallback UI.

### 237. What is the benefit of the component stack trace from error boundary?
- **Benefit:** Provides detailed information about where the error occurred in the component tree, aiding in debugging and fixing issues.

### Component Methods and Props

### 238. What is the required method to be defined for a class component?
- **Method:** The `render` method is required for class components to specify what to render.

### 239. What are the possible return types of the `render` method?
- **Return Types:**
  - **React elements:** JSX or React.createElement calls.
  - **Arrays:** Arrays of React elements.
  - **Strings and Numbers:** Render text content directly.

### 240. What is the main purpose of the constructor?
- **Purpose:** Initializes state and binds methods to the component instance.

### 241. Is it mandatory to define a constructor for React components?
- **No:** You can omit the constructor if you don’t need to initialize state or bind methods. React will handle it.

### 242. What are default props?
- **Definition:** Default props are values assigned to props if they are not provided by the parent component.
  ```jsx
  MyComponent.defaultProps = {
    text: 'Default Text'
  };
  ```

### 243. Why should you not call `setState` in `componentWillUnmount`?
- **Reason:** Calling `setState` in `componentWillUnmount` can lead to unexpected behavior or memory leaks because the component is about to be removed from the DOM.

### 244. What is the purpose of `getDerivedStateFromError`?
- **Purpose:** Provides a way to update state in response to an error, allowing components to render fallback UI.

### 245. What is the method order when a component is re-rendered?
- **Order:**
  1. `render`
  2. `componentDidUpdate` (if applicable)
  3. `getDerivedStateFromProps` (if applicable)

### 246. What are the methods invoked during error handling?
- **Methods:**
  - `getDerivedStateFromError`
  - `componentDidCatch`

### 247. What is the purpose of the `displayName` class property?
- **Purpose:** Provides a name for the component in debugging tools and error messages, useful for identifying components.

### 248. What is the browser support for React applications?
- **Support:** React supports modern browsers and provides polyfills for older versions. However, the latest features may not work in very old browsers without additional polyfills.

### 249. What is the purpose of `unmountComponentAtNode` method?
- **Purpose:** Unmounts a React component from a DOM node, cleaning up and removing the component’s rendered output.

### Code-Splitting and React Features

### 250. What is code-splitting?
- **Definition:** Code-splitting is a technique to split your code into multiple bundles that can be loaded on demand, reducing the initial load time of your application.

### 251. What is the benefit of strict mode?
- **Benefit:** Strict mode helps identify potential problems in your application by running checks and providing warnings about deprecated practices and unsafe lifecycle methods.

### 252. What are Keyed Fragments?
- **Definition:** Keyed Fragments are a way to provide keys to `Fragment` components to help React identify them and optimize rendering.

### 253. Does React support all HTML attributes?
- **No:** React supports most standard HTML attributes but has some differences, such as using `className` instead of `class` and handling attributes like `style` as objects.

### Higher-Order Components and Debugging

### 254. What are the limitations with HOCs?
- **Limitations:**
  - **Props Conflicts:** Can lead to prop name collisions if not managed properly.
  - **Wrapper Hell:** Multiple HOCs can create deeply nested component trees, making debugging harder.
  - **Static Methods:** HOCs do not automatically pass down static methods or properties.

### 255. How to debug forwardRefs in DevTools?
- **Method:** Use the React DevTools to inspect the components and check if `forwardRef` is working correctly. You may need to check the `ref` prop and ensure it is passed down properly.

### Prop Types and Conditional Rendering

### 256. When do component props default to true?
- **Scenario:** This typically happens when you use boolean props with a default value of `true` if the prop is not explicitly provided.

### 257. What is Next.js and major features of it?
- **Definition:** Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) applications. Major features include:
  - **Automatic Code Splitting**
  - **Server-Side Rendering**
  - **Static Site Generation**
  - **API Routes**
  - **Built-in CSS and Sass support**

### 258. How do you pass an event handler to a component?
- **Method:** Pass the event handler as a prop to the component.
  ```jsx
  function MyComponent({ onClick }) {
    return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
  }

  function App() {
    const handleClick = () => {
      alert('Button clicked!');
    };

    return <MyComponent onClick={handleClick} />;
  }
  ```

### 259. Is it good to use arrow functions in render methods?
- **Recommendation:** Avoid using arrow functions in render methods as it creates a new function instance on every render, which can impact performance. Define methods as class properties or outside the render method.

### 260. How to prevent a function from being called multiple times?
- **Method:** Use techniques like debouncing or throttling to limit the number of times a function can be called.
  ```jsx
  import { useCallback } from 'react';
  import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

  function MyComponent() {
    const handleClick = useCallback(debounce(() => {
      // Handle click
    }, 300), []);

    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
  }
  ```

### 261. How does JSX prevent Injection Attacks?
- **Method:** JSX escapes values inserted into the DOM to prevent injection attacks. It treats values as strings and does not allow direct insertion of HTML, thus preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### 262. How do you update rendered elements?
- **Method:** Update elements by changing state or props, which will trigger React’s re-rendering process and update the DOM accordingly.

### 263. How do you say that props are read-only?
- **Reason:** Props are immutable within a component. They are passed from parent to child components and cannot be modified directly by the child component.

### 264. How do you say that state updates are merged?
- **Reason:** When using `setState` in a class component, React merges the new state with the existing state, rather than replacing it entirely.

### 265. How do you pass arguments to an event handler?
- **Method:** Use an arrow function or bind method to pass arguments.
  ```jsx
  function MyComponent() {
    const handleClick = (arg) => () => {
      console.log(arg);
    };

    return <button onClick={handleClick('Hello')}>Click me</button>;
  }
  ```

### 266. How to prevent a component from rendering?
- **Method:** Use `shouldComponentUpdate` in class components or `React.memo` in functional components to control rendering.
  ```jsx
  const MyComponent = React.memo((props) => {
    // component code
  });
  ```

### 267. What are the conditions to safely use the index as a key?
- **Conditions:**
  - **Static List:** The list should not change or reorder.
  - **Unique:** Ensure each item is uniquely identified.

### 268. Should keys be globally unique?
- **No:** Keys only need to be unique among sibling elements in the same list, not globally.

### 269. What is the popular choice for form handling?
- **Popular Choices:** Libraries like `Formik` and `React Hook Form` are popular for handling form state and validation in React applications.

### 270. What are the

 advantages of Formik over Redux Form library?
- **Advantages:**
  - **Less Boilerplate:** Formik requires less setup compared to Redux Form.
  - **Simplicity:** Provides a simpler API and better performance.
  - **Less Dependency on Redux:** Formik does not require Redux, making it easier to integrate with other state management solutions.

### 271. Why do you not require to use inheritance?
- **Reason:** React uses composition instead of inheritance. Components can be combined and extended through composition rather than inheritance, promoting better code reuse and maintainability.

### 272. Can I use web components in React application?
- **Yes:** React can integrate with web components using the `react-shadow` library or directly through the custom elements API.

### 273. What is dynamic import?
- **Definition:** Dynamic import allows you to load modules asynchronously at runtime, enabling code-splitting and reducing initial load times.
  ```jsx
  import('module').then(module => {
    // Use module
  });
  ```

### 274. What are loadable components?
- **Definition:** `react-loadable` or `@loadable/component` are libraries that enable dynamic import and code-splitting for React components, allowing you to load components asynchronously.

### 275. What is the suspense component?
- **Definition:** `React.Suspense` is a component that allows you to handle asynchronous rendering. It lets you specify a fallback UI while components are loading.
  ```jsx
  <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <MyComponent />
  </React.Suspense>
  ```

### 276. What is route-based code splitting?
- **Definition:** Route-based code splitting loads different parts of your application based on the route, allowing each route to be split into separate bundles that load on demand.

### 277. Give an example on how to use context?
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  const MyContext = React.createContext();

  function MyProvider({ children }) {
    const [value, setValue] = React.useState('default');
    return (
      <MyContext.Provider value={{ value, setValue }}>
        {children}
      </MyContext.Provider>
    );
  }

  function MyComponent() {
    const context = React.useContext(MyContext);
    return <div>{context.value}</div>;
  }
  ```

### 278. What is the purpose of default value in context?
- **Purpose:** Provides a default value for the context when a component does not have a matching `Provider` above it in the component tree.

### 279. How do you use `contextType`?
- **Method:** Assign `contextType` to a class component to access context values.
  ```jsx
  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    static contextType = MyContext;

    render() {
      const context = this.context;
      return <div>{context.value}</div>;
    }
  }
  ```

### 280. What is a consumer?
- **Definition:** A Consumer is a component that subscribes to a context and receives its value. It can be used to access context values from within a function component.
  ```jsx
  <MyContext.Consumer>
    {value => <div>{value}</div>}
  </MyContext.Consumer>
  ```

### 281. How do you solve performance corner cases while using context?
- **Method:** Use context sparingly and split contexts to avoid re-rendering large parts of the component tree. Consider memoizing context values and using `React.memo` for components.

### 282. What is the purpose of `forwardRef` in HOCs?
- **Purpose:** `forwardRef` allows you to pass a `ref` through a component to one of its children, enabling access to the underlying DOM node or component instance.

### 283. Is the `ref` argument available for all functions or class components?
- **No:** `ref` is available only for functional components wrapped with `forwardRef` or class components. It is not directly available in regular functional components.

### 284. Why do you need additional care for component libraries while using forward refs?
- **Reason:** Component libraries often use `forwardRef` to pass refs to underlying DOM elements or components. Proper handling ensures refs are correctly forwarded and avoid issues with ref forwarding.

### 285. How to create React class components without ES6?
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  var MyComponent = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    render: function() {
      return (
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          {this.state.count}
        </button>
      );
    }
  });
  ```

### 286. Is it possible to use React without JSX?
- **Yes:** React can be used without JSX by using `React.createElement` directly to create elements.
  ```jsx
  const element = React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello, world!');
  ```

### 287. What is the diffing algorithm?
- **Definition:** The diffing algorithm is a method used by React to efficiently update the DOM by comparing the previous and next virtual DOM trees and applying the minimal set of changes.

### 288. What are the rules covered by the diffing algorithm?
- **Rules:**
  - **Elements of the same type:** Compare only elements of the same type.
  - **Component keys:** Use keys to identify components and track changes in lists.
  - **Reorder lists:** Detect and handle reordering of list items based on keys.

### 289. When do you need to use refs?
- **Scenarios:**
  - **Accessing DOM elements:** To interact with or measure a DOM node.
  - **Integrating with third-party libraries:** When you need to use a library that requires direct DOM access.
  - **Managing focus, text selection, or animations.**

### 290. Is it necessary that prop must be named as `render` for render props?
- **No:** While `render` is a common convention, you can name the prop anything. The important part is that it is a function that returns React elements.

### 291. What are the problems of using render props with pure components?
- **Problems:**
  - **Re-render issues:** Pure components may re-render if render props change, even if the data doesn’t.
  - **Prop drilling:** Can lead to deeply nested component structures.

### 292. How do you create an HOC using render props?
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  function withRenderProps(WrappedComponent) {
    return function RenderPropsComponent(props) {
      return <WrappedComponent {...props} render={props.render} />;
    };
  }

  // Usage
  const EnhancedComponent = withRenderProps(MyComponent);
  ```

### 293. What is windowing technique?
- **Definition:** Windowing (or virtualization) is a technique to render only a portion of a large list of items to improve performance, by only rendering the items that are currently visible.

### 294. How do you print falsy values in JSX?
- **Method:** You can print falsy values by ensuring they are explicitly rendered as strings or use conditional rendering.
  ```jsx
  <div>{false || 'Default text'}</div>
  ```

### 295. What is the typical use case of portals?
- **Use Case:** Portals are used to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the parent component. Common use cases include modals, tooltips, and dropdowns.

### 296. How do you set default value for uncontrolled components?
- **Method:** Use the `defaultValue` attribute for form elements to set initial values for uncontrolled components.
  ```jsx
  <input defaultValue="Initial value" />
  ```

### 297. What is your favorite React stack?
- **Answer:** Preferences vary, but a popular stack includes React with Redux or Zustand for state management, React Router for routing, and Tailwind CSS or styled-components for styling.

### 298. What is the difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM?
- **Difference:**
  - **Real DOM:** Directly manipulates the actual DOM, which can be slow and inefficient for complex updates.
  - **Virtual DOM:** A lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to perform updates efficiently by calculating differences and applying minimal changes.

### 299. How to add Bootstrap to a React application?
- **Method:** Install Bootstrap via npm or use a CDN.

### 301. Is it recommended to use CSS-in-JS technique in React?
- **Recommendation:** It depends on your project needs. CSS-in-JS can provide scoped styles and dynamic styling but can add complexity. Other solutions include CSS modules or styled-components.

### 302. Do I need to rewrite all my class components with hooks?
- **No:** It’s not necessary to rewrite all class components with hooks. Hooks offer an alternative to class components but both approaches are valid.

### 303. How to fetch data with React Hooks?
- **Example using `useEffect`:**
```jsx
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  function DataFetchingComponent() {
    const [data, setData] = use

State(null);

    useEffect(() => {
      fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => setData(data));
    }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once on mount

    return <div>{data ? data.name : 'Loading...'}</div>;
  }
```
### 304. How to debug React components?
- **Methods:**
  - **React DevTools:** Provides an interface to inspect React component hierarchy and state.

  ```jsx
  function ControlledInput() {
    const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');

    const handleChange = (e) => setValue(e.target.value);

    return <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />;
  }
  ```

### 314. What are uncontrolled components in React?
- **Definition:** Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally, and their value is accessed using refs.
  ```jsx
  function UncontrolledInput() {
    const inputRef = React.useRef();

    const handleClick = () => {
      alert(inputRef.current.value);
    };

    return (
      <>
        <input ref={inputRef} />
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Show Value</button>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```

### 315. How to avoid prop drilling in React?
- **Methods:**

### 319. What is the purpose of `useReducer` hook?
- **Purpose:** Manages complex state logic in functional components, similar to `useState` but with a reducer function for updating state based on actions.

### 320. How do you handle CSS-in-JS in a React application?
- **Method:** Use libraries like `styled-components`, `emotion`, or `@mui/styles` to define and manage styles directly within JavaScript files.

### 321. What is the purpose of `useImperativeHandle` hook?
- **Purpose:** Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using `ref` with `forwardRef`, allowing you to expose specific methods or properties to parent components.

### 322. How do you create and use a custom hook?
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  function useCustomHook() {
    const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');

    const updateValue = (newValue) => {
      setValue(newValue);
    };

    return [value, updateValue];
  }

  function MyComponent() {
    const [value, updateValue] = useCustomHook();

    return <input value={value} onChange={(e) => updateValue(e.target.value)} />;
  }
  ```

### 323. What is the `useContext` hook used for?
